## Paper Structure

- Intro: aims and constraints
  - track jacks of a harpsichord for interacting with digital instrument
- Current work done and extraction from those
  - TODO: Find example papers
      - inspiration taken
      - concepts developed
- What happened / what was done
  - algorithm
  - calibration
- Measure success of  what was done
- What happens next?


## Paper Ideas

- Jack tracking of harpsichord
- effects of mechanical noise
- player  interaction experience with and without haptics
